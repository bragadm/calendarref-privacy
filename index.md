# CalendarRef Privacy Policy

CalendarRef does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

The app:
- Does not require accounts or logins
- Does not use analytics or tracking
- Does not display ads
- Does not make network requests
- Operates entirely offline on your device

All calendar calculations are performed locally on the device.

If this behavior changes in a future version, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
